## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to design an effective Version Control System (VCS) strategy that suits our organizational and project needs. We aim to compare Monorepo and Microrepo approaches, evaluate them against relevant criteria, and choose a path that best supports scalability, maintainability, and team collaboration.

## Introduction

Version Control Systems (VCS) are the backbone of modern software development, enabling collaboration, version tracking, and deployment management. Choosing the right repository structure is critical to ensure the system remains scalable, flexible, and efficient over time.

Two popular strategies for organizing repositories are:

- **Monorepo (Monolithic Repository)**
- **Microrepo (Multiple Repositories)**

Each has distinct characteristics, advantages, and trade-offs.

---

## Monorepo

A Monorepo approach consolidates multiple projects or services into a single repository. Organizations like Google, Meta, Uber, and Airbnb famously use Monorepos.

**Characteristics:**
- Single repository containing all services, libraries, and common components.
- Centralized control over versioning and standards.
- Shared tooling and dependencies.

**Advantages:**
- Easier to make atomic changes across multiple projects.
- Unified CI/CD pipelines.
- Promotes code reuse and sharing.
- Centralized access control and permissions.

**Challenges:**
- Repository can grow very large.
- Complex build and test processes.
- Tools must handle large-scale repositories efficiently.

---

## Microrepo

A Microrepo approach maintains each project or service in its own separate repository. Companies like Amazon, Netflix, LinkedIn, and Oracle follow this pattern.

**Characteristics:**
- Each service, library, or module has its own isolated repository.
- Teams have autonomy over their repositories.
- Different services can have different lifecycles.

**Advantages:**
- Simpler repositories that are easier to clone, build, and maintain.
- Decentralized ownership and responsibility.
- Flexibility in choosing technologies and versioning policies.

**Challenges:**
- Cross-repository changes are complex.
- Dependency management can become difficult.
- CI/CD pipelines must coordinate across multiple repositories.

| **Companies**    | Google, Meta, Uber, Airbnb                        | Amazon, Netflix, LinkedIn, Oracle               |
| **Collaboration**| Shared repository, shared ownership               | Separate repositories, independent ownership   |
| **Dependency**   | Shared dependencies                               | Independent dependency management              |
| **Scalability**  | Single standard applied across all services      | Services define their own standards             |
| **Tooling**      | Bazel, Buck, Nix, Lerna                           | Gradle, Maven, NPM, CMake                       |
| **Atomic Changes**| Easy across all services                         | Difficult across multiple repositories          |
| **Access Control**| Centralized                                      | Decentralized                                   |
| **Build Complexity**| High for large codebases                       | Moderate depending on repo size                 |

## Conclusion

After evaluating both strategies in the context of our project goals â€” including scalability, collaboration, dependency management, and future growth â€” **we will follow a Monorepo strategy**.

**Reasons:**
- We require **atomic changes across multiple services**.
- **Centralized standards** will promote consistency.
- Our team collaboration model benefits from **shared codebases**.
- **Simplified dependency management** reduces overhead.

We will invest in appropriate tooling (e.g., Bazel, Nx, Lerna) to handle the complexity of a Monorepo as our project scales.

**However, we will set clear modular boundaries within the Monorepo** to ensure scalability and minimize conflicts.
